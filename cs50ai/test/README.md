## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Tests

### Guide

1. Make sure you have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your machine. Anything above `Python 3.4+` should work.
2. Install `pytest` by running `pip install pytest` in a terminal. More information about `pip` [here](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/).
3. Make a copy of the test file and paste it in the **same folder** as the project that you want to test.
    > For example, if you want to test your code for `degrees.py`, make a copy of `degrees_test.py` in the **same folder** as your `degrees.py` and other files that came along with the project, like `util.py`, `large/` and `small/`.
4. Navigate to the project folder and run `pytest` or `pytest <project>_test.py` in a terminal.
    > For example, navigate to `degrees/` and run `pytest` or `pytest degrees_test.py`.

### Example

## üö© Useful pytest Flags

- Run `pytest -s` to show print statements in the console
- Run `pytest -vv` for verbose mode
- Combine both flags `pytest -s -vv` for extra verbose mode
- Run `pytest --durations=n` to see the `n` slowest execution time
- Install `pytest-repeat` with `pip` and then run `pytest --count n` to repeat the test for *n* times

## üíª My Setup

Each test should take less than 30 seconds, depending on Python's I/O and your code efficiency.

- Windows 10 Home Build 19042
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz
- Python 3.9.5 64-bit
- Visual Studio Code w/Pylance (latest release)
