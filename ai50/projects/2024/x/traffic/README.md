The main thing that did not go well was looking up documentation for OpenCV and TensorFlow while there was an ongoing power outage. This meant that I could not look up the documentation on the websites (or download the initial code and data set), rendering this problemset nearly impossible. When my power finally returned after 48 hours, the most difficult part was still looking up the documentation. I made a separate python script to test the load data function on one image at a time to get used to os and sys. Listdir would cause some errors since it would also go through the .DS_Store files on MacOS when I was trying to loop over the directories (image categories instead). I also forgot labels were integers, while the category names in listdir are strings, and that there had to be a label for each image such that the input variables (images, labels) have the same size. I also accidently passed set into Sequential instead of list due to a lack of familiarity with Tensorflow.
